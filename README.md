===========

Master repo for the Living Forgotten Realms website. There is currently nothing to see here. Please don't send me a pull request until I have all the core site files committed (I'll remove this sentence when that is done; see TODOs below).

This repo is owned by the LFR-Contributors organization so that we can easily add future contributors.

TODO: Restructure and commit files from current live website (MSM)

TODO: Break campaign rules documents into chapter files in a suitable format (MSM)
